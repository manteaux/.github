# Manifesto

Last Updated: *December 12, 2024*

## People Before Profit

We're inspired by Mozilla's motto "People Before Profit." We believe large profits only entail greed and should not matter.

Our profits and revenue should only be used for making our software better and increasing our quality standards for a better user experience.

## Anywhere, Everywhere

We are not one business, one industry, and not one product.  We should do anything and everything. Experiment, and explore new uncharted areas, and be unafraid of any obstacles in that path unexplored before.

## Open and Free

We believe our software should be open and free to the public. This means shipping our software with Open Source licenses and letting anyone who wishes use our software.

We are believers in a push for public good, and believe for everyone to help contribute to Manteaux to foster a healthy, happy, stable open community.

## Everyone Gets A Say

We believe everyone should get a fair say in all actions. If they believe X might be better than the proposed Y and come with valid reasonings and criticisms, their word should be take impersonal and not be taken for granted among an onslaught of contributors.

Once any organization locks up who gets a say is when the public is no longer who their target is, instead it becomes investors and stockholders.
